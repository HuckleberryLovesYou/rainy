## Installation

### Linux

To install rainy run the following command:

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/HuckleberryLovesYou/rainy.git && cd ./rainy && sudo make install && rainy
```

After this you can just type `rainy` to execute it.

To uninstall rainy, you can run `make uninstall`.

### Windows

If you don't want to be able to configure rainy, you can download the latest executable from the GitHub releases and add it to your PATH environment variable.
Now, reopen any terminals you have currently opened, and type `rainy` in your terminal.

If you want to **configure** it, you will have to clone the Repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/HuckleberryLovesYou/rainy.git
```

After that, edit the config section in the rainy.py file located in `.\rainy\src\`.
Now, add the folder (most likely called `rainy`), where the `rainy.bat` file is located to your PATH environment variable.
Reopen any terminals you have currently opened, and then type `rainy` in your terminal.

## Dependencies

* `python`
* `python3-requests`
* `python3-emoji`
* `make`

You can install all of them from your distribution repositories.

## Configuration

* You can edit the config at the **top** of `/usr/local/bin/rainy` (or .\rainy\src\rainy.py on windows) and set unit of measurements, date formats.
* You can also set to show city name or/and the current date and time if you want to.

#### temperature_unit

Here you can specify what unit of measurement you would like to use for the temperature.
You can choose between ¬∞C (Celsius), ¬∞F (Fahrenheit) and ¬∞K (Kelvin).
Every temperature is rounded to one decimal place.
Default: ¬∞C

#### wind_speed_unit

Here you can specify what unit of measurement you would like to use for the speed of wind.
You can choose between mph (Miles per Hour), km/h (Kilometre per Hour), m/s (Meter per Second) and Knots.
Every wind speed is rounded to one decimal place.
Default: km/h

#### show_city

This enables or disables the display of the city that was fetched by your location using your public IP Address.
If you use a VPN Rainy will not get the weather for the right location, but rather get the weather at the location of your VPN exit node.
Default: True

#### show_date

This enables or disables the display of the current date.
The format of the display date can be changed at `date_format`.
Default: True

#### date_format

Here you can specify the format of the current date you would like to use.
You can choose between MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, YYYY/MM/DD, YYYY-MM-DD and DD.MM.YYYY.
This has no effect if show_date is False.
Default: DD.MM.YYYY

#### show_time

This enables or disables the display of the current time.
Currently, there is no way of changing the format of the time.
Default: True

## Update

What if there's an update?
You can just update your local repository with running `git pull` in the cloned folder. After that run `sudo make install`.
